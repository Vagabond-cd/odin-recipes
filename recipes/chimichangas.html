      <h3>Chickens chimichangas</h3>
        <p>I love chimichangas. And I guarantee you will too after following this recipe. 
           For the uninformed a chimichanga is essentially a deep-fried burrito. Typically 
           comprised of some kind of shredded or ground meat(this recipes uses chicken but you
           can substitute for just about anything.),cheese, onions and peppers, all
           wrapped up in a flour tortilla and deep-fried till golden brown. I personally enjoy
           them with a fresh salad of lettuce, onions, and guacamole. A healhy drizzle of 
           sourcream sauce makes it even better.</p>

  <h2>Steps</h2> 
    <ol>
      <li>Heat a small amount of oil in a large saucepan medium-high heat. Sear chicken on both sides for 2-3 minutes.Add water, and season with chilipowder, salt, cumin, black pepper, garlic, powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 15 minutes. </li>
      <li>After 15 minutes, stir in 4 oz of green chiles, onion, and garlic; continue simmering until the liquid has reduced to 1 cup. Reserve remaining 3 oz of chopped chiles.</li>
      <li>Remove the chicken, shred with forks, and return to the broth</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Whisk water and bouillon cube until the water has thickend and the bouillon cube has dissolved, about 4 minutes. Whisk in reserved green chiles and the sour cream; season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F(190 degrees C)</li>
      <li>Place a tortilla onto your work surface, then spoon about 1/3 cup of the chicken filling halfway between the bottom edge and center of the tortilla. Flatten the filling into a rectanguluar shape with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle about 1 oz of the Monterey Jack cheese over the filling.</li>
      <li>Fold the bottom of the tortilla snugly over the filling, then forld in the left and right edges. Roll the chimichanga up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder; secure the ends with wooden toothpicks. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.</li>
      <li>Cook the chimichangas, 2 at a time in the hot oil until they are crisp and golden brown on both sides, about 1 minute per side.</li>
      <li>Drain on a paper-towel lined plate, and remove the toothpicks</li>
      <li>Top with sour cream sauce and serve.</li>
